# Hello-world
Making this to learn coding for video game development.
Hello, my name is Joey. 
I have graduated highschool for 2020 and I am wanting to learn how to code and become a video game designer and/or software developer.
I am 19 years old, I don't have a job related to coding but I would like to learn how to code and then apply.
I have done a very small amount of coding but I would like to relearn and be tought as someone who is new.
